corpse-ttl=Number of seconds corpses remain on the ground
spawns-per-tick=Maximum number of new biters per tick

[mod-setting-description]
corpse-ttl= Standard factorio is 5 minutes. With each biter spawning several more, large attacks can leave thousands of corpses on the ground. Use this setting to determine how fast those corpses will disappear, in seconds.
spawns-per-tick=Global limit on number of biters to spawn at once. Lower will increase performance but also make it easier (higher chance of hitting the limit and not spawning.)
